# Jaguar (red circle) food web

Predation (as well as the competition, herbivory or mutualism) is one of four biological processes that control the diversity and abundance of species and organize the structure and dynamic of communities. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the trophic network of the jaguar (Panthera onca) throughout their distribution using data compiled from the literature. It was also simulated the removal of jaguar to evaluate the network structure in the absence of the species. Food items consumed by the jaguar and the other species of mammals were listed in a binary matrix (1 = consumed, 0 = non-consumed). The food web of the jaguar presented six trophic levels and, a high richness of species and density of links. After removal of the jaguar, there was the loss of one trophic level and approximately 20% of links. Connectance and fractions of intermediate, omnivorous and herbivores were almost the same. Jaguar removal has impacted only on two proximal trophic levels and did not affect immediately others species of network.
